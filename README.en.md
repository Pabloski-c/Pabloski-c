### Current Project: Personal Portfolio (Cyberpunk Edition)

I developed my own personal brand platform, fusing an immersive design with real Full Stack functionalities. It is not just a landing page, it is a connected application.

* **MERN Architecture:** Frontend in **React+Vite** and RESTful API Backend in **Node/Express** for message management.
* **Total Synchronization with GitHub:**
    * Projects are automatically fetched from the GitHub API.
    * This very "About Me" section you are reading now renders dynamically on the portfolio! (DRY Concept).
* **Advanced UX/UI:** Hacker/Terminal aesthetic with **Tailwind CSS**, fluid animations with **Framer Motion**, and interactive components like `react-type-animation`.
* **Infrastructure:** **MongoDB Atlas** database for persistence and distributed deployment on **Vercel** (Front) and **Render** (Back).

## Featured Project: NEXUS (Hermanos Jota Furniture Store)

As the final project for the ITBA certification, I developed a complete E-commerce from scratch, simulating a real production environment.

* **Architecture:** SPA (Single Page Application) with **React** + RESTful API with **Node/Express**.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Secure Authentication:** Complete Registration and Login using **Bcrypt** (hashing) and **JWT** for session management.
    * **State Management:** Shopping cart and user session managed globally with **React Context API**.
    * **Persistence:** Cloud database with **MongoDB Atlas**.
    * **Security:** Protected routes on Frontend and Authorization Middleware on Backend.
    * **Deploy:** Frontend deployed on **Vercel** and Backend on **Render**.

## Continuous Learning & Interests

Beyond code, I am interested in project management and the new frontiers of AI:

* **Agile Methodologies:** Experience working with the **Scrum** framework (Sprints, Dailies, Retrospectives, Backlog management).
* **Artificial Intelligence:** Currently researching **AI Agents** (Planning, Memory, Tool Usage) and frameworks like LangChain and CrewAI.
* **Future Thinking:** Interest in prospective thinking methodologies and detecting future signals.
